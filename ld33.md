My Ludum Dare 33 Jam entry. The player assumes the role of a huge troll. The troll can pick up and throw rocks and logs, trample over puny humans and punch things. The player's objective is to cause destruction as much as possible in one minute.

The timer starts after the gate is destroyed. Beyond the gate are towers, houses, human soldiers (archers and swordmen) and siege machines (catapult and ballista). After one minute is up, the troll dies.
