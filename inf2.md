INF2 is an endless top-down shooter (again) made with Unity 4. It is also an attempt on making a clone of Crimsonland and at the same time learning to use  Mecanim. INF2 was created in a month, and was used to promote Game Development course in MMU Open Day 2013.

There are six weapons available (three shotguns, two assault rifles, one sniper), nine power ups (freeze, medkit, slowmo, shield, 2x XP, weapon boost, sprint, sentry gun and bomb) and eleven perks that upgrades the player's health, movement speed and weapon attributes.
